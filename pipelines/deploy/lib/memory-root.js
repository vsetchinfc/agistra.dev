/**
 * memory-root.js — single source of truth for where agent memory files and
 * the projects/tasks root live on disk for a given hubType.
 *
 * Free/customer-archive tiers (dev, dev:graph) store memory as plain repo
 * files at <hubRoot>/memory/<agent>.md (the repo-files.md storage plugin)
 * and tasks as plain repo files at <hubRoot>/projects/<project>/task_*.md.
 * Vault-backed paid tiers (dev:sub, ops, publish) store memory as an
 * Obsidian vault note at <hubRoot>/vault/Memory/<agent>.md and tasks as
 * vault notes at <hubRoot>/vault/Tasks/<project>/task_*.md (the obsidian.md
 * storage plugin — see the Storage Plugin Contract in
 * agents/skills/agent-foundations/SKILL.md, and the vault-canonical record
 * convention it documents for vault-backed tiers).
 *
 * VAULT_BACKED_HUB_TYPES mirrors OBSIDIAN_HUB_TYPES in
 * lib/obsidian.doctor-plugin.js exactly — both lists gate on the same set of
 * paid, vault-shaped tiers. If that list ever changes, update both.
 *
 * This module is the single "resolve memory/tasks root for this hubType"
 * helper referenced by every call site that must never drift independently:
 *   - lib/extras.js         (deploy-time memory + projects/tasks scaffold —
 *                            hubType is a param)
 *   - doctor.js             (checkMemoryFiles, checkProjectsDir — hubType
 *                            read from workspace.config.json)
 *   - lib/session-cli.js    (sessionInit's hotSummary default — hubType read
 *                            from workspace.config.json, same as doctor.js)
 *   - targets/claude-code.js (deployClaudeCode's own memory-template copy —
 *                            source-repo-only tooling, never shipped into a
 *                            deployed hub, so it can import this freely)
