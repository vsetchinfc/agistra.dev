# repo-files Storage Plugin

This file is the `repo-files` implementation of the storage plugin contract defined in
`agent-foundations/SKILL.md` (Storage Plugin Contract section). It formalizes the
current free-tier behavior — all storage is plain Markdown files in the repository.
No behavior change from this ticket; this is an extraction of existing mechanics into
an explicit, pluggable form.

The vault-backed plugin used by other tiers covers the paid-tier implementation.

## Plugin Identity

- **Plugin name:** `repo-files`
- **Tier:** `dev` (free tier) and any repo-file-backed hub
- **Tooling required:** standard file I/O (Read/Edit/Write tools, or equivalent)

## Memory store

### read-memory(agent)

Read `memory/<agent>.md` from the hub root.

Example: `memory/builder.md`, `memory/architect.md`.

### list-memory-agents()

List the `.md` files directly under `memory/` (top-level only, non-recursive).
Excludes `memory/archive/` (a subdirectory, not an agent file) and non-agent files
such as `memory/working-buffer.md`. Each remaining filename, minus the `.md`
extension, is an agent id (e.g. `architect`, `builder`, `router`, `tester`). Supports
tooling such as the memory-index CLI, which must enumerate every agent's memory
file rather than read one known agent at a time.

### write-memory-entry(agent, tier, content)

Edit the HOT, WARM, or COLD section of `memory/<agent>.md`. The tier argument
identifies which section heading to target. Prepend new HOT entries (most recent
first); append WARM/COLD entries at the bottom of the relevant section.

### archive-memory(agent, date)

Write the archived snapshot to `memory/archive/<agent>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`. The date
argument is formatted `YYYY-MM-DD`. The dreaming skill calls this at the end of each
consolidation cycle before compacting the live file.

### compact-memory(agent, newContent)

Rewrite `memory/<agent>.md` with the compacted content. The dreaming skill supplies
the full new file content after distilling HOT→WARM→COLD decay. This is a full
overwrite, not an append.

## Task store

Task files live at `projects/<project>/task_<id>_<state>_<slug>.md`.

The filename infix `<state>` is the derived index of `status:` frontmatter; the
`status:` field is authoritative. The CLI reconciles the infix with
frontmatter on every transition (`check:tickets` / `fix:tickets`).

### create-task(project, id, frontmatter, body)

Write a new file at `projects/<project>/task_<id>_<state>_<slug>.md`, where
`<state>` is the value of the `status:` field in frontmatter and `<slug>` is a
short kebab-case description derived from the ticket title. Include the full YAML
frontmatter block followed by the task body.

Required frontmatter fields: `status`, `verifier`. Optional: `fail-count`, `parked`,
`github-issue` (or the active tracker plugin's reference field), `agent`, `model`,
`skills`, `token-budget`.

### read-task(id)

Glob `projects/**/*task_<id>_*.md` and read the matching file. State is read from
the `status:` frontmatter field (authoritative); the filename infix is a derived
convenience index only.

### list-tasks(project, stateFilter)

Glob `projects/<project>/task_*.md`. If `stateFilter` is provided, filter by the
`status:` frontmatter field value. Return the matching file paths and their `status:`
values.

### update-task-fields(id, fields)

Edit the YAML frontmatter of the task file identified by `id`. The `fields` argument
is a map of frontmatter key→value pairs to update. Do not rename the file from this
operation — use `transition-state` when a rename is required.

### transition-state(id, newState)

1. Edit the `status:` frontmatter field to `newState`.
2. Rename the file to replace the `<state>` infix with the new state token.
   The state-to-filename-token mapping:
   - `state:ready-for-implementation` → `ready-for-implementation`
   - `state:in-progress` → `in-progress`
   - `state:ready-for-review` → `ready-for-review`
   - `state:ready-for-qa` → `ready-for-qa`
   - `state:changes-requested` → `changes-requested`
   - `state:qa-passed` → `qa-passed`
   - `closed` → `done`
3. The CLI (`check:tickets` / `fix:tickets`) reconciles filename infix with
   `status:` frontmatter for any file the agent edits but does not rename.

### append-task-section(id, section, content)

Append `content` under the named section heading in the task file (e.g. `## Log`,
`## QA Report`, `## Token Spend`). If the section heading does not exist, create it
at the end of the file before appending.

---

## Document store

Documents live under `docs/<collection>/`. Common collections: `decisions` (ADRs),
`architecture`, `reports`, `proposals`.

### create-document(collection, name, content)

Write a new file at `docs/<collection>/<name>`. The `name` argument includes the
file extension (e.g. `ADR-NNN-foo.md`). Create the directory if it does not exist.

### read-document(collection, name)

Read `docs/<collection>/<name>` from the hub root.
