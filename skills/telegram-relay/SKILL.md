# Telegram Relay

Use this skill when Router needs to bridge your team and the remote team across Telegram. The skill defines Router's behaviour rules on top of the hub relay daemon (`cli/relay/`). Router calls `relay_send` for outbound; inbound arrives as parsed jobs via `relay_inbox_peek` (task_33).

## Scope

- **In scope:** classifying parsed inbound Telegram messages from the remote agent, dispatching Builder or Tester as subagents to handle the request, composing replies, posting state-change notifications outbound, enforcing information classification.
- **Out of scope:** internal Architect ↔ Builder or Architect ↔ Tester traffic; reading raw Telegram channels; building bot infrastructure.

## Channel

- One shared Telegram group where Router (your team's bot) and the remote agent both operate.
- **Inbound addressing:** remote team messages must start with Router's configured display name (from `agents.router.displayName`, e.g. `Atlas, …`) or `Router, …` when no display name is set. The relay daemon ignores group messages without this salutation.
- **Outbound addressing:** every `relay_send` body is prefixed with the remote agent's name (from `remoteTeam.agentName`, e.g. `Max, …`) by the daemon when missing.
- The team lead is in the channel for awareness; team-lead-only escalations go via `memory/router.md` HOT and surface at morning-standup or end-of-day dreaming.

## Inbound — Remote Agent to Your Team

The runtime parses the remote agent's message and invokes Router with structured fields:

- issue number
- pull request URL or number
- branch
- changed areas
- local validation results
- CI results
- blockers or exceptions
- requested next action

Router never reads the raw channel and never owns the Telegram tool surface — the runtime does.

### Classification

Use the internal-relay state vocabulary:

| Incoming signal | Workflow state | Action |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| PR ready, review request | `review_requested` | Spawn Builder as subagent with parsed fields |
| CI failure, build failure | `ci_failed` | Spawn Builder as subagent; include CI exception |
| Ready for QA, retest | `qa_requested` | Spawn Tester as subagent in **Pre-QA Readiness Check mode only** |
| Blocked, waiting on something | `blocked` | Spawn Builder if engineering blocker; log to Router HOT if decision blocker |
| Approval, scope, price, timeline | `decision_required` | Log to Router HOT; surface at standup or dreaming |
| FYI, status update | `info_only` | Compose short ack; no subagent spawn |
| Missing context | `unclear` | Ask one concise clarification question; no subagent spawn |

### Subagent dispatch prompt template

When spawning Builder or Tester, pass:

- Sender: remote agent
- Workflow state: `[classified state]`
- Original message context (parsed fields from runtime)
- Expected response type: `answer` | `confirmation of receipt` | `clarification`
- Constraint: response will be posted on Telegram via the runtime; keep it short, inter-team-sharable, and free of team-internal or confidential content.

### Tester-as-subagent constraint

Subagent-spawned Tester cannot run live tests — browser-driven QA needs the shared browser tab and a direct Tester session. On `qa_requested` inbound, Tester operates in **Pre-QA Readiness Check mode only** (see `qa-ticket-workflow`):

- confirms the Developer → QA handoff payload is complete
- queues the ticket in `memory/tester.md` HOT
- returns `READY` or `INCOMPLETE: [missing fields]`

If the remote agent requests actual test execution, Tester's response is a queue confirmation only.

### Reply composition

Router takes the subagent response, applies the information-classification check (see below), then calls `relay_send({ text })` to post. The reply attributes the originating agent (e.g., `"Builder: ..."`, `"Tester: ..."`).

## Outbound — Builder / Tester to Remote Agent

Outbound is **state-machine driven**, not free-form messaging. Builder or Tester dispatches Router as a subagent only after a state transition that warrants inter-team notification.

### State-transition trigger table

| State transition | Sending agent | Notification template |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| any → `state:ready-for-implementation` on a delegated ticket | Builder | "Max, Ticket #N ready for remote agent to implement. `<link>`" |
| any → `state:ready-for-qa` on a delegated ticket | Builder | "Max, Ticket #N in state:ready-for-qa, please pick up first-pass QA. `<link>`" |
| `state:ready-for-qa` → `state:changes-requested` (Tester-side defect) | Tester | "Max, Ticket #N retest failed, defects on report. `<link>`" |
| `state:ready-for-qa` → `state:qa-passed` | Tester | "Max, Ticket #N retest passed clean." |
| any → `state:blocked` requiring remote team input | Builder | "Max, Ticket #N blocked on `<reason>`. Need `<input>`." |

Transitions on non-delegated tickets do not generate Telegram notifications.

### Dispatch prompt format from Builder / Tester

```text
Router, notify remote agent:
  Ticket: #N
  State: [current state]
  Action: [what's expected from the remote agent]
  Context: [one short line if needed]
```

### Validation checklist before Router sends outbound

- ticket exists and is in the claimed state
- the state transition is on the trigger table above
- the message body matches a template; no copies of internal context
- **data minimisation:** include only the ticket reference, state label, and required action — no context beyond what is in the trigger template
- no secrets, no credentials, no scope/price/timeline language (information-classification check)

If any check fails, return an error to the dispatching agent. The dispatching agent appends a retry note to its own HOT memory.

### Outbound send sequence (after validation passes)

1. Optionally call `relay_status` — confirm daemon is reachable (`ok: true`).
2. Compose the message from the trigger-table template for the claimed state transition.
3. Call `relay_send({ text: "<composed message>" })` — daemon auto-prefixes `remoteTeam.agentName` (e.g. `Max, …`) if Router omitted it.
4. Return the tool result (message id or error) to the dispatching agent.

Example (Builder dispatch → Router outbound):

```text
Dispatch from Builder:
  Router, notify Max:
    Ticket: #58
    State: state:ready-for-qa
    Action: please pick up first-pass QA
    Context: relay stack E2E probe

Router actions:
  1. Validate ticket #58 is delegated and transition is on trigger table
  2. relay_status → ok
  3. relay_send({ text: "Ticket #58 in state:ready-for-qa, please pick up first-pass QA. <link>" })
     → daemon sends: "Max, Ticket #58 in state:ready-for-qa, please pick up first-pass QA. <link>"
  4. Reply to Builder: sent (message_id …) or error with retry note
```

## Information Classification

Three tiers, applied at Router's outbound validation step:

| Tier | Examples | Inter-team sharable? |
| ---- | -------- | -------------------- |
| `inter-team-sharable` | PR open and ready for review; defect summaries; QA verdicts on tickets that originated from the remote team | **Yes** |
| `team-internal` | Architecture-decision rationale, agent-internal debate, internal planning | **No** |
| `confidential` | Scope, price, timeline, client commitments, commercial assumptions | **No** |

Default rule when uncertain: if the ticket originated from the remote team, share progress. Otherwise refuse and escalate to Router HOT.

## Audit Policy

The ticket itself is the audit. Builder and Tester comment on the ticket in their normal workflow when work is performed or state changes. Router does NOT create redundant GitHub comments mirroring Telegram traffic. Router's outbound is a short state-change notification, not a record.

## Failure Modes

| Failure | Response |
| ------- | -------- |
| Unknown sender | Do NOT reply on channel. Append to `memory/router.md` HOT; surfaces to the team lead at morning-standup or dreaming. |
| Telegram unreachable inbound | Runtime queues. Router takes no action until invoked with a parsed message. |
| Telegram unreachable outbound | `relay_send` returns error. Return error to the dispatching agent. The dispatching agent appends a retry note to its own HOT. |
| Ambiguous reference (e.g., "the ticket") | Ask one concise clarifying question via the runtime; no subagent spawn until resolved. |
| Classification failure | Escalate to Router HOT; surfaces at next standup or dreaming. No guess. |
