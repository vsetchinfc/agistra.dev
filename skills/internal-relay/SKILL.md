# Internal Relay

Workflow-state classification vocabulary for mapping inbound signals from the remote agent to a routing decision. This skill is intentionally narrow — it defines states and destinations only. The bridge behaviour, subagent dispatch templates, outbound rules, information classification, and failure modes all live in the relay skill configured for your workspace.

## Workflow State Mapping

| State | Trigger signals | Route to |
| ----- | --------------- | -------- |
| `review_requested` | "ready for review", "PR open", "please review" | Builder |
| `ci_failed` | "CI failed", "test failed", "build failed" | Builder |
| `qa_requested` | "ready for QA", "needs QA", "acceptance test", "retest" | Tester (Pre-QA Readiness Check mode only — see `qa-ticket-workflow`) |
| `blocked` | "blocked", "waiting on", "cannot proceed" | Builder if engineering blocker; Router HOT for team lead if decision blocker |
| `decision_required` | "needs approval", "scope", "price", "timeline", "client promise" | Router HOT for team lead; surfaces at standup or dreaming |
| `info_only` | "FYI", "status", no requested action | None — Router composes short ack |
| `unclear` | Missing issue/PR, state, owner, or requested action | Sender — ask one concise clarifying question |

End-of-day and start-of-day signals are handled by `dreaming` and `morning-standup`. They are not relay-channel-only and do not belong in this table.
