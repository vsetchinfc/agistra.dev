# Architecture Mode

This skill gives the Architect first-principles architecture discipline. Architect pauses all other work, enters architecture mode, produces decision-ready artifacts, then creates a GitHub story or epic ticket as the handoff artifact before handing off to Builder.

## Think Before Designing

Answer these three questions before producing any artifact. Stop if any answer is "not sure" and collect evidence first.

1. **What exact problem does this solve?** Name the symptom, failing flow, or gap — not the solution.
2. **What assumptions am I making?** List them explicitly. If an assumption cannot be verified before the decision, label it as such.
3. **What is the smallest slice that validates the architecture?** If the answer is "the whole thing", the scope is too large — split it.

This is the pre-flight. It takes two minutes and prevents hours of redesign.

## When to Enter Architecture Mode

Load this skill when any of these are true:

- the team lead says: "architecture mode", "architect this", "ADR", "C4", "PRD gap", "design decision", or "system boundary"
- The work has high ambiguity, multiple reasonable technical approaches, security/privacy/data risk, integration risk, or cross-module blast radius
- the work cannot be implemented safely because architecture or acceptance criteria are unsettled
- A story or epic ticket needs to be created to structure downstream implementation

## Complexity Tier

Before running the intake checklist, assess the tier. The tier determines how much ceremony is warranted.

| Tier | Criteria | Process |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| **Fast-track** | Single surface, no security/data/privacy risk, low blast radius, clear precedent in the codebase | 5-question fast intake (below). Skip quality attribute scenarios and full rubric unless a specific attribute is at risk. |
| **Full** | Multi-surface, security/data/privacy involved, high ambiguity, no precedent, cross-module blast radius, external commitments | Full intake checklist + full rubric + quality attribute scenarios. |

When in doubt, default to **Full**. Fast-track is earned by low blast radius, not by impatience.

### Fast-Track Intake (5 questions)

1. What is the exact problem?
2. What existing pattern should this follow?
3. What is the proposed approach and why is it the right one?
4. What is the first validation slice?
5. What are the acceptance criteria?

If the answer to question 2 is "no existing pattern", escalate to Full.

## Mode Rules

- Do not implement while architecture-critical ambiguity remains. Architecture mode exits only after the team lead confirms the direction or ambiguity is resolved.
- Start from the most concrete entry point available: user journey, failing flow, dependency boundary, explicit decision point, or observed symptom.
- Separate facts from assumptions. Label every assumption explicitly.
- Name the exact artifacts and boundaries supporting each claim: route, screen, component, API, DTO, schema, config key, migration, metric, log event, failing test, or command output.
- If critical evidence is missing, explicitly stop to collect it before finalizing the decision.
- Ask the team lead focused clarification questions when the decision cannot be made safely from available evidence.
- Present real alternatives — not strawmen, not a single preselected option.
- Explore at least two viable approaches when the decision is non-trivial.
- State what is chosen, why, what is rejected, and what risk remains.
- Include operability: failure modes, detection, recovery, and verification where relevant.
- Connect every major recommendation to the next observable state that would show it is working: test, metric, log, trace, contract check, deploy health signal, or user-visible behavior.
- Convert architecture decisions into implementation-ready acceptance criteria before returning to builder mode.
- Prefer the smallest implementation slice that can validate the architecture without locking in unnecessary complexity.
- Create a GitHub story or epic ticket as the final output when the work will spawn multiple implementation tickets.
- If client-facing material is needed, hand off to `planner-mode` after technical truth is established.

## Architecture Intake Checklist

Before producing any artifact, identify:

- Purpose and scope of the decision
- Entry lens: user, test, system, analytics, or debug
- Source material reviewed (tickets, files, docs, existing ADRs)
- Exact evidence already available and the specific artifacts or boundaries it comes from
- Current system constraints and existing patterns
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements and quality attributes
- Data, API, integration, security, and privacy concerns
- Cross-boundary surfaces affected: UI, client, service, data, infrastructure, and external integrations
- Current observable state and the next state that would validate the recommendation
- Existing decisions or patterns that must be preserved
- Missing information and verification needs
- Stakeholder gates, including team lead approval

## Architecture Entry Lenses

Choose the lens that best matches the question, and say so explicitly in the output.

| Lens | Start from | Work toward |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| User | The user's first meaningful interaction, pain point, or broken journey | The architecture and dependencies that shape that experience |
| Test | Edge cases, failure paths, and what must be provably true | The architecture that makes those checks reliable |
| System | Infrastructure dependencies, deployment/runtime constraints, and coupling | The application structure that must respect them |
| Analytics | User outcomes, business metrics, or adoption signals | The architectural causes and instrumentation gaps behind them |
| Debug | Symptoms, incidents, or degraded states | The root architectural causes and corrective boundaries |

Use one primary lens. Add a secondary lens only when it changes the decision materially.

## Evidence and Scope Discipline

- Prefer one precise architecture gap over a vague request to "improve the architecture".
- Every recommendation should point to the smallest useful unit of evidence.
- Prioritize options by impact, dependency order, operational risk, effort, and user impact.
- If evidence is weak, recommend evidence collection as the first slice instead of pretending certainty.
- Break implementation into small, independently testable slices with clear rollback boundaries.
- Record why the recommendation matters and which evidence elevated its priority.

## Architecture Principles

### Philosophy

Architecture is decision work. Every major artifact must clarify what was chosen, why it was chosen, what was rejected, and what risk remains. A 30-year architect knows that almost every system failure was predictable from the original design. Make the right trade-offs explicit before the first line of code.

**Rule of thumb:** If the architecture cannot be explained in five minutes to a senior developer, it is too complex. Complexity is a liability. Simplicity is a design achievement.

### Schools of Thought

Apply the most suitable framework per project context. No single school is dogma.

| School | When to apply |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Domain-Driven Design | Systems with complex business rules, multiple teams, or long-lived domain models |
| Clean Architecture | Systems where testability and framework independence is critical |
| C4 Model | All architecture communication work — default communication medium |
| Event-Driven / Event Sourcing | Audit trail, temporal queries, or decoupled async workflows as first-class requirements |
| Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters | Isolating core domain logic from infrastructure concerns |
| Microservices | Only when independent deployability, team autonomy, or scaling isolation is a documented requirement — not as a default posture |

**Cross-cutting rule:** Before selecting a pattern, state the problem it solves and confirm that problem exists in this system. Pattern selection without problem identification is architectural cosplay.

### Quality Attributes

Every architecture package must define measurable quality attribute scenarios where relevant.

| Attribute | Architecture question | Required expression |
| --------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Availability | What must stay online, for whom, during which failures? | Target uptime, tolerated degraded modes, dependency failure behaviour |
| Latency | How fast must critical paths respond? | P50/P95/P99 targets by use case |
| Throughput | What load must the system absorb now and later? | Requests per second, peak factor, burst duration |
| Durability | What data loss is acceptable? | RPO, RTO, backup cadence, restore verification |
| Security | What must be protected, from whom, at which boundaries? | Threat model, trust boundaries, access model |
| Privacy | What personal or regulated data exists and how is it controlled? | Classification, retention, deletion, residency |
| Operability | How will the system be observed, alerted, recovered, maintained? | Logs, metrics, traces, runbooks, ownership |
| Maintainability | How will teams safely change the system over time? | Module boundaries, ownership, compatibility rules |
| Cost | What financial envelope constrains the design? | Monthly run-rate estimate, scaling cost curve, cost risks |

**Quality attribute scenario format:**

```
When [stimulus] occurs under [environment], the system should respond by
[response] within [measurable target], verified by [test, metric, or check].
```

**Rule:** Never use vague language such as "scalable", "secure", or "highly available" without a measurable scenario attached.

### Security and Privacy

Security is architecture, not a final checklist. Privacy is architecture, not a legal appendix.

Every architecture package involving users, tenants, integrations, payments, or sensitive data must define:

- **Trust boundaries** — where data crosses between users, systems, networks, services, tenants, or privilege levels
- **Threat model** — STRIDE: spoofing, tampering, repudiation, information disclosure, denial of service, elevation of privilege
- **Authentication model** — identity provider, session/token model, service identity, machine-to-machine auth
- **Authorization model** — roles, permissions, policy decision point, policy enforcement point, least-privilege boundaries
- **Tenant isolation model** — row, schema, database, account, or deployment isolation; explicit bypass risks
- **Secrets model** — storage, injection, rotation, audit, break-glass access
- **Data classification** — public, internal, confidential, personal, regulated, secret
- **Retention and deletion model** — deletion semantics, legal hold, backup retention, right-to-erasure impact

**Rule:** A security control that has no owner, no enforcement point, and no verification method is not a control. It is a wish.

### Data Architecture

Data outlives code. Most architecture failures eventually become data failures.

Every data architecture must define:

- **System of record** — which component owns each data concept
- **Consistency model** — strong consistency, eventual consistency, explicit inconsistency windows
- **Migration strategy** — expand/contract, backfill, dual-write, cutover, rollback, validation
- **Backup and restore** — cadence, restore test frequency, RPO/RTO, tenant-level restore expectations
- **Analytics boundary** — when operational data is replicated to reporting stores instead of queried directly

**Rule:** Never design a write path without also designing the correction path. Bad data will happen; architecture must say how it is detected, corrected, and audited.

### Integration and API Discipline

Integrations fail at the contract boundaries.

Every API, event, webhook, or external integration must define:

- **Contract ownership** — who owns the contract and approves breaking changes
- **Versioning strategy** — URL, header, event type, or schema version
- **Compatibility policy** — backward compatibility rules, deprecation window, migration support
- **Error contract** — stable error codes, retryability, validation errors, correlation IDs
- **Idempotency** — required for payment, provisioning, workflow, webhook, and command-style operations
- **Rate limits and quotas** — tenant, user, and integration limits

**Rule:** A contract is not complete until failure behaviour is documented. Success-only APIs are incomplete architecture.

### Architecture Anti-Patterns

Actively search for and call out these failure patterns early:

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Distributed monolith | Multiple deployables remain tightly coupled and must change together |
| Shared database between services | Ownership, schema evolution, security, and deployment independence collapse |
| Premature microservices | Operational cost arrives before team or scaling need justifies it |
| Chatty synchronous chains | Latency, fragility, and cascading failure increase with every hop |
| Unbounded queues | Backlogs hide overload until recovery is expensive or impossible |
| Leaky tenant isolation | One tenant's data, load, config, or permissions can affect another tenant |
| Anemic domain model | Business rules scatter across services, jobs, and UI code |
| Report queries on transactional paths | Analytics pressure degrades operational workloads |

**Rule:** Naming an anti-pattern is not enough. State the observed evidence, impact, and recommended correction.

## ADR Format — Michael Nygard Default

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Decision title in imperative mood]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNN]

## Context
[What is the problem? What forces are at play? What constraints exist?
State without solution bias. A reader who has never seen this system
should understand the problem from this section alone.]

## Decision
[What was decided? "We will use X" not "X will be used".]

## Alternatives Considered
[Genuine alternatives, not strawmen. Each alternative must have been
seriously evaluated with the reason it was rejected.
Minimum: two alternatives.]

## Consequences
[What does this decision make easier? Harder? What new problems does it
create? Both positive and negative consequences.]

## Assumptions
[What must be true for this decision to hold? If any assumption is
invalidated, this ADR should be revisited.]
```

**ADR quality bar:**

- An ADR with no genuine alternatives is an announcement, not a decision record.
- An ADR without consequences is incomplete — every decision has costs.
- An ADR without assumptions is overconfident.

## C4 Diagram Standards

| Level | When produced |
| ----- | ------------- |
| Context (L1) | Always. Every engagement. |
| Container (L2) | Always. Every engagement. |
| Component (L3) | Only when a Container is complex enough that two senior developers would disagree on its internal structure. |
| Code (L4) | Never. Code is the truth at this level. |

Non-negotiable rules:

- All diagrams are PlantUML source files committed to version control. No static PNGs as the primary artifact.
- Every element has a label describing *what it is* and a technology annotation.
- Every relationship has a label describing *what it does*, not just an arrow.
- A diagram that requires a 10-minute verbal explanation has failed. Revise it.

## Architecture Review Rubric

| Criterion | Passing standard |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| Technical correctness | Claims grounded in source material, standards, evidence, or explicit assumptions |
| Feasibility | Builder can turn the package into implementation work without major reinterpretation |
| Completeness | Scope, gaps, ADRs, diagrams, risks, and acceptance criteria all represented |
| Clarity | Senior engineers understand the implementation implications |
| Consistency | Terms, boundaries, diagrams, ADRs, and specs agree with each other |
| Operability | Failure modes, observability, recovery, ownership, and release concerns addressed |
| Security/privacy | Trust boundaries, data classes, access model, and risks explicit |
| Practical implementation value | The package reduces engineering ambiguity instead of adding ceremony |

**Rule:** Any criterion below passing standard becomes a known gap with an owner and resolution path.

## Decision Output

Use this structure for the architecture recommendation:

```markdown

### Options Considered
| Option | Pros | Cons | Risk |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A | ... | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... | ... |

### Decision
[chosen approach and rationale]

### Risks and Mitigations
- [risk -> mitigation]

### Verification Plan
- [how Builder validates in implementation]
- [what observable signals should change: tests, logs, metrics, traces, deploy health, user-visible behavior]
- [what Tester should verify, if applicable]

### Open Questions
- [questions for the team lead only if unresolved]
```

## Worked Examples

See `skills/architecture-mode/EXAMPLES.md` for illustrated examples. Reuse the decision shape, not the repo-specific answer.

## Story / Epic Ticket Output

After producing the architecture recommendation and receiving team lead confirmation, create a GitHub story or epic ticket:

```markdown
## Story: [Architecture area or system capability]

**Type:** Story / Epic
**Source:** Architecture mode output — [date]

### Context
[2-3 sentences summarising the architectural decision and why this work exists]

### Architecture Constraints
- [constraints all implementation tickets must preserve]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [testable criterion 2]

### Implementation Scope
[Outline of sub-tickets or implementation slices to be created by Builder]

### Out of Scope
- [explicit exclusions]

### Risks
- [residual risks for implementers to be aware of]
```

## Exit Criteria

Architecture mode is complete when:

- the team lead confirms the selected approach, OR
- The decision is low-risk and fully supported by source evidence

After exit, Architect either hands implementation directly to Builder or creates sub-tickets from the story/epic.
